Professor: Bruce Maggs

Instructions:

Run the server from ransomware_server/server.py

Run the software through ransomware_software/gui.py

This project is only intended for educational purposes and is intended to show how a ransomware functions and how they can be tackled by studying them.
There are a number of security flaws in this program that have been deliberately left as is.
Some code has been stripped from this program to deter misuse so that it does not work out of the box.
